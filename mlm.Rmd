These regressions and plots are how you should begin to think about longitudinal data analysis. These growth models (the simplest form of longitudinal data analysis) are just a bunch of regressions for each person plus a little extra stuff. MLM is just a fancy regression equation. We want to create a line for everyone. Does someone go up? Does someone go down? On average, do people's lines indciate that this construct increases or decreases? That is it. Seriously. 

What is different from normal regression? Extra error terms, mostly. For regression, we think of error as existing in one big bucket. For MLMs (and other longitudinal models) we will be breaking up unexplained variance (error) into multiple buckets. 

This is where fixed effects and random effects come into play. We will discuss this more next class, but the gist is that fixed effects are the regression coefficients you are used to. Fixed effects index group level change. Do people decline in memory across time, on average? Random effects vary among individuals (in the longitudinal models we are talking about) and index variation from the group. While most people decline in their memory, does everyone? In other words, an average trajectory will be termed a fixed effect and the random effect indexes how much variability there is around that group level effect. This extra variability we measure through random effects means that we are explaining more variance and thus there is less unexplained variance. 

### Modeling frameworks: MLM & SEM
In this class (and in the field) two primary techniques are used with longitudinal models: MLM and SEM. At some levels they are completely equivalent. At others, one is better than the other and vice versa. 

We will start with MLM/HLM is a simple extension of standard regression models. As a result it is easy to interpret and implement. In terms of longitudinal data it is best suited to run models when the time of measurement differs from person to person (compared to equal intervals). For this class we will use lme4 and brms as our MLM program but there are many others we could use e.g., nlme. 

SEM is related to regression in that regression is a subset of SEM techniques. In other words, an SEM program could run a simple regression analysis. 

The primary advantage of MLM is that you may have assessment waves that vary in length between participants. An assumption of SEM models is that everyone has the same amount of time between assessment waves (though this assumption can be relaxed). MLM is also better suited for complex error structures and complex nesting above and beyond assessments within person. It is also easier to model interactions. Currently, it is easier to do MLM within a Bayesian framework too. 

SEM primary advantage is the ability to account for measurement error via latent assessment of the repeated measures. Other advantages include the ability to model multiple DVs at once, and do so in a flexible manner to look at, for example, the associations between change in one construct and change in the another (though these are also possible with MLMs). Another major advantage is the ability to look at latent groups via latent class or mixture models. 

Bottom line: MLM is probably best suited for "basic" or "standard" growth models. More complex analyses of change with multiple variables would benefit from an SEM approach. This is also an oversimplification.
